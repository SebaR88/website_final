      <h2>Key Project Highlights from 2025</h2>
      
      <h3>Luxury & Fashion</h3>
      <p>
        In the Luxury & Fashion category, I delivered creative transcreation projects for a global fashion brand, developing inventive newsletters and marketing texts designed to resonate with target audiences in their native cultures. Every piece was refined through detailed quality reviews that ensured strict adherence to style guidelines and character limitations, maintaining brand consistency through innovative yet precise adaptations.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Travel & Lifestyle</h3>
      <p>
        In the Travel & Lifestyle sphere, I supported a leading luxury cruise brand by adapting copy for a variety of communication channels. I crafted compelling content for both B2B and B2C newsletters, managed extensive post-DTP processing for brochures, and translated engaging voice-over scripts. My approach balanced creative ingenuity with technical precision to meet specific project requirements while enhancing brand messaging.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Media & Transcreation Excellence</h3>
      <p>
        I led creative transcreation tasks for media projects that demanded a seamless integration of visual and verbal storytelling. By reimagining promotional content to preserve both creative vision and strict brand regulations, I ensured that every campaign communicated its message powerfully and consistently.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Glossary & Terminology Management</h3>
      <p>
        I developed and maintained detailed glossaries, ensuring consistent and clear terminology across multilingual projects. This work underpins technical and marketing communications alike, reinforcing a unified brand voice on a global scale.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Language Leadership & Quality Management</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond creative transcreation, I oversaw robust quality management processes for large-scale multilingual projects. By implementing rigorous post-DTP checks and comprehensive website localization testing, I ensured that every deliverable met the highest standards of quality and strategic consistency.
